# Book List Webpage

In this project I fully focused on object-oriented programming, which allowed me to write clean and readable code. I also used bootstrap library to quickly style the form for the user without wasting much time on styling with standard css

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- adds new books to the table list
- remove existing books from the table

### Links
- Live Site URL: https://shmitu1.github.io/Book-List/


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Style with Bootstrap library
- JavaScript ES6+
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
